# LLMNR

# Exploitation

For this purpose, we will use `responder` to retrieve the ntlm hash of the victim, and then crack it with `john`.

Let's run our responder to listen for ntlm traffic.

Now we will go to our victim machine and try to access a resources that does not exist.

Let's go back to our machine.

![ntlm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyberkhalid/cyberkhalid.github.io/main/assets/img/ipentest/smbrelay6.png)

As you can see, we have retrieved ntlm hash of administrator. We will save it in a file and crack it using `john`.
