# SUDO - LD_PRELOAD

LD_PRELOAD is a function that allows any program to use `shared libraries`. If the `env_keep` option is enabled, we can generate a shared library which will be loaded and executed before the program is run. Please note the `LD_PRELOAD option will be ignored` if the real user ID is different from the effective user ID.
