### WriteDacl Enumeration 

We will get current user's sid by executing `whoami /user`, import powerview, then execute the below command to get the list of objects on which we have `WriteDacl` right.

Command
```powershell

get-objectacl -resolveguids | ? {($_.securityidentifier -eq "[our_current_user_sid]") -and ($_.activedirectoryrights -like "*WriteDacl*")}

```

Below image shows the current user `usman` has WriteDacl right on `Domain Admins` group.

# Exploitation

Let's check our current group.

![acl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyberkhalid/cyberkhalid.github.io/main/assets/img/ipentest/aclgroupgenall3.png)

Here `usman` is a member of `Domain Users` group. We are going to exploit `WriteDacl` to add `usman` to `Domain Admins` group.
