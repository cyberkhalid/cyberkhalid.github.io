# Telnet

Telnet is a networking protocol and software program used to access remote computers and terminals over the Internet or a TCP/IP computer network. It runs on port 23 by default.

# Enumeration

## Scanning With Nmap

We can use nmap to scan telnet service which by default runs on port 23.

```bash
nmap -sT -sV -p 23 [target_ip]
```

Above image shows telnet is running on port 23/tcp on our target.

# Bruteforcing Telnet

## hydra

Using hydra , we can bruteforce credentials of telnet, which if successful will allow us to login to our target system.

```bash
hydra -l [username] -P [/path/to/password/wordlist] telnet://[target_ip]
```

In the above image we were able to get a valid credential `user1:user1`.

# Exploitation

## Telnet Client

With the valid password in hand, we can login to our target system using `telnet client`.

In the above, we were able to login to the system.
## Metasploit

We can also obtain command shell with metasploit.

# Sniffing

Traffic sent to and received from telnet is not encrypted. An attacker can take advantage of this to sniff telnet traffic and retrieve a clear-text credential.

## Wireshark

Analysing telnet traffic revealed the clear-text credential of telnet
