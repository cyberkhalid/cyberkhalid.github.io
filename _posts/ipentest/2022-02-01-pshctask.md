# Scheduled Tasks

We can achieve persistence by adding our reverse shell payload to scheduled task. We could even just configure a task where every minute a reverse shell is sent to you. Which is exactly what we're going to do.


# Exploitation

We are going to leverage schtasks to achieve persistence. We will create a reverse shell executable and make it to run every minute .

Now , we will setup our reverse shell listener and wait for our script to be triggered.
