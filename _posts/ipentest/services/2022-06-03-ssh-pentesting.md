# SSH
***SSH*** stands for Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell, is a protocol for secure remote login from one computer to another.It provides users with a secure way to access and manage a computer over an unsecured network.

# Technigues

These are techniques that can be used to leverage ssh protocol during pentesting.

- Enumeration
- Bruteforce
- Pivoting
- Persistence
- Exfiltration 

## Enumeration

Enumeration: Is a technigue of discovering potential attack vectors in the system.

## Bruteforce

Bruteforce: A brute force attack is a technigue uses trial-and-error to guess login credentials.

## Pivoting

Pivoting: Is a technique of routing network traffic from a compromised system to another system or networks. Is a technigue that adversary uses to move from one compromised system to another system or to access resources(networks, ports, etc..) that are not accessible.

## Persistence

Persistence: Is a technigue that allows adversary to maintain access to a compromised system for a period of time.

## Exfiltration

Exfiltration: Is a technigue of removing/transfering data from a compromsied system.
