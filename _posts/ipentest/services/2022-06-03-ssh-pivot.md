# Pivoting
***Pivoting*** Is a technique of routing network traffic from a compromised system to another system or networks. Is a technigue that adversary uses to move from one compromised system to another system or to access resources(networks, ports, etc..) that are not accessible.

# Technigues

- Portforwarding

## Local Port Forwarding

Is a technigue of forwarding the network traffic from a client machine to the server machine. The SSH client listens for connections on a configured port, and when it receives a connection, it tunnels the connection to an SSH server.
