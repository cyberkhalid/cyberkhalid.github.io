# Pass The Ticket(Ptt)

Pass the Ticket(Ptt) is a credential theft technique that enables adversaries to use stolen Kerberos tickets to authenticate to resources (e.g., file shares and other computers) as a user without having to compromise that userâ€™s password.

# Exploitation

To execute a pass the hash ticket, we need to first obtain the `kerberos TGT` of the target user using any kind of techniques. In this case we have the kerberos TGT of an administrator, so we are going to execute ptt attack using `mimikatz`.

As you can see, we have successfully passed the ticket of the administrator. We can now access the powershell session of the domain controller by executing `enter-pssession [dc]`.
