# Password Spraying 

Is an attack that uses a single or small list of passwords against many different accounts to attempt to acquire valid account credentials.

# Exploitation

We have got a valid credential of user `saifullah`, we will try to enumerate users from the domain and then execute `password spray` attack against the users using the password of saifullah.

Let's enumerate users with `crackmapexec`.

```bash

crackmapexec smb [ip] -u saifullah -p sPassword@123 --users

```

Since we have got the list of users, we will execute password spray attack against them with the password of saifullah `sPassword@123` as the password.

As you can see, we got three accounts using thesame passwords.
