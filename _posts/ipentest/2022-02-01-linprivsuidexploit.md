# SUID / SGID Executables - Known Exploits 

# Enumeration

We are going to exploit a vulnerable suid/sgid executable to escalate our privileges to `root`. Let's find all the SUID/SGID executables on the machine.

As you can see, suid/sgid is set on `exim-4.84-3`. By searching on exploit-db, we found out that it's vulnerable to local privilege escalation

# Exploitation

We will copy the exploit and execute it on our target machine, which if successful will provide us with a root shell.
