# /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow

Most modern Linux operating systems use a combination of /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow to store user account information including password hashes in /etc/shadow. By default, /etc/shadow is only readable by the root user. Adversaries may attempt to dump the contents of /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow to enable offline password cracking.

# Exploitation

Since we have root permission, we can read content of `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`.

```bash

cat /etc/passwd
cat /etc/shadow

```

*content of /etc/passwd*

![etc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyberkhalid/cyberkhalid.github.io/main/assets/img/ipentest/oscredetc1.png)

*content of /etc/shadow*

![etc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyberkhalid/cyberkhalid.github.io/main/assets/img/ipentest/oscredetc2.png)

We will save them (`/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`) in a separate files and then transfer the files to our machine. 

## Unshadow

With the files transfered to our machine, we will match the files (`/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`) in a single file using `unshadow`. This is needed in order to crack the hashes.

```bash

unshadow passwd.txt shadow.txt > unshadow.txt

```

![etc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyberkhalid/cyberkhalid.github.io/main/assets/img/ipentest/oscredetc3.png)

## Cracking

We can now crack the hashes using `john`.

```bash

john unshadow.txt --wordlist=/home/cyberkhalid/passwords.txt

```

![etc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyberkhalid/cyberkhalid.github.io/main/assets/img/ipentest/oscredetc4.png)

In the above image, we were able to crack two hashes.

## Access Via SSH

We can ssh to the target machine using the credentials that we have just cracked.

![etc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyberkhalid/cyberkhalid.github.io/main/assets/img/ipentest/oscredetc5.png)

In the above image, we were able to login to `user1` account.

# Mitigations

- Ensure that root accounts have complex, unique passwords across all systems on the network.
- Follow best practices in restricting access to privileged accounts to avoid hostile programs from accessing such sensitive information.
