# Cached Domain Credentials

***Cached domain credentials*** allows authentication to occur in the event a domain controller is unavailable. Adversaries may attempt to extract credentials from the cache.

# Exploitation

## Mimikatz

We can dump cache credential using `mimikatz`. To do that, we need to download or transfer mimikatz to our target system(windows), then execute it `./mimikatz.exe`. After executing mimikatz, we will elevate our privilege to `nt authority` by executing `token::elevate`. With our privilege elevated, we can dump cache credential by executing `lsadump::cache`.

# Mitigations

- Consider adding users to the "Protected Users" Active Directory security group. This can help limit the caching of users' plaintext credentials.
- Consider limiting the number of cached credentials (HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version\Winlogon\cachedlogonscountvalue)
- Ensure that local administrator accounts have complex, unique passwords across all systems on the network.
- Do not put user or admin domain accounts in the local administrator groups across systems unless they are tightly controlled.
