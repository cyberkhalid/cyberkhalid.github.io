# Broken Authentication : Bruteforce

A brute force attack uses trial-and-error to guess login info, encryption keys, or find a hidden web page. Hackers work through all possible combinations hoping to guess correctly.

This login form does'nt have bruteforce protection which will allow us to bruteforce user's credentials. 

There are lot of tools to bruteforce login form but we will use burpsuite intruder here. We will enter an invalid credential `test:test`, intercept the request in burpsuite, and then forward the request to intruder.

For this purpose, we will choose `cluster bomb` attack type as we are going to bruteforce both username and password, and then load our wordlists in payload section .

As you can see, `admin:admin` gave different status code `302`, which means we got valid credential. 

We will attempt to login with the credential `admin:admin`.
