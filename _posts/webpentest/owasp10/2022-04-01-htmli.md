# Html Injection

# Exploitation

The webapp takes in user's firstname and lastname and then displays a welcoming message with the supplied firstname and lastname.

Let's supply our firstname and lastname as `firstname: html, lastname: exploit` .

We got a text saying `welcome html exploit`. Since it's reflecting our input back, it might be vulnerable to html injection if it does'nt sanitize user's inputs. We can further inspect the page.

We will inject html button in the firstname field and html link in the lastname field and see whether they will be displayed on the page. Our inputs will be something like `<button>Click</button>` for the firstname field and `<a href=#>Here</a>` for the lastname field.

As you can see, the button and link appeared on the page.
