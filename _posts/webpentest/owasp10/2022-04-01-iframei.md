Is displaying the content of the page based on the value of `page-to-frame`. In this case the value of `page-to-frame` is `styling.php`, so if we can replace it with the url of another web page, it will display the page on the website. Let's replace it with the url of our own website.

As you can see, we got it displayed on the page.

Note: For the purpose of this experiment, i have cloned facebook login form and hosted it on my local webserver. That's why facebook login form was displaying on the website.
