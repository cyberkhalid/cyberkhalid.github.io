# Command Injection

***Command Injection*** is a cyber attack that involves executing arbitrary commands on a host operating system (OS). Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell. In this attack, the attacker-supplied operating system commands are usually executed with the privileges of the vulnerable application.
