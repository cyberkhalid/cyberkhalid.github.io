# Broken Authentication -> Username Enumeration

Username enumeration is a technique of guessing a valid usernames on a server or web application. 

# Exploitation

In this test, we are going to use two usernames with invalid passwords, one is already registered username `admin` and the other is unregistered username `anything`. We will try to distinguish registered username from unregistered by examining the error message.

Let's test for registered user `admin` with invalid password

We got an error message saying `password incorrect`, this looks like the username is correct. But let's test for the unregistered username to see if we can get different error message. We will enter `exploit` as the username.

As you can see, this time we got different error message saying `account does not exist`. This differences in the error messages will allow attacker to distinguish registered usernames from the others.
