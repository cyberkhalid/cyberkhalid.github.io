# Server-side request forgery (SSRF)

Server-side request forgery (also known as SSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce the server-side application to make requests to an unintended location.

# Exploitation

This webapp has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system using an url. We are going to exploit it to access admin interface at `http://localhost/admin`.

We will click on `check stock` button and intercept the request in burp.

As you can see it was using url of an api to fetch data. Let's replace the url with `http://localhost`.

Great!, we have accessed internal admin interface.
