# Session hijacking -> Session Fixation

Session Fixation is an attack that permits an attacker to hijack a valid user session. The attack explores a limitation in the way the web application manages the session ID, more specifically the vulnerable web application. When authenticating a user, it doesnâ€™t assign a new session ID, making it possible to use an existent session ID.

# Exploitation

- The attacker accesses the web application login page and receives a session identifier generated by the web application. This step is not necessary if the web application accepts arbitrary session IDs.

- The attacker uses an additional technique such as CRLF Injection, man-in-the-middle attack, social engineering, etc., and gets the victim to use the provided session identifier. This depends on how the web application handles session IDs. It may be as simple as sending a malicious URL but may also require the attacker to create a fake website.

- The victim accesses the web application login page and logs in to the application. After authenticating, the web application treats anyone who uses this session ID as if they were this user.

- The attacker uses the session identifier to access the web application, take over the user session, and impersonate the victim. Further actions depend on the attacker and web application functionality.


Note: No Lab For Demonstration 

# Mitigations

- Change the session ID right after the user logs in.
- Invalidate session IDs after a timeout.
