# Clickjacking

Clickjacking is an interface-based attack in which a user is tricked into clicking on actionable content on a hidden website by clicking on some other content in a decoy website

# Exploitation

Clickjacking attacks are possible whenever websites can be framed. We can determine whether or not a website can be framed from its response header.

Website can be framed If neither `X-Frame-Options` nor `Content-Security-Policy` header is used.

We will examine the response header.

As you can see, there was neither `X-Frame-Options` nor `Content-Security-Policy` in the response header, which means the site can be framed and so it's vulnerable to clickjacking.
