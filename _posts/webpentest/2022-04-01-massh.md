# Mass Assignment -> Horizontal Privilege Escalation

# Exploitation

![mass](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyberkhalid/cyberkhalid.github.io/main/assets/img/ipentest/massc1.png)

This webaapp is vulnerable to mass assignment , which will allow attacker to access information that he doesn't have permission.

Since we have been given a credentials, we will login to see how the application is working.

As you can see , we have access to company 1 information, but our goal here is to access company 2 information.

To do that, we will login again and intercept the request in burpsuite.

The application was submitting this `user[username]=user1&user[password]=pentesterlab`.

What if there exist a company attribute? If so, we can overwrite the company attribute by adding either `user[company_id]=2` or `user[company]=2` to our request.

Let's try this trick with this payload `user[username]=user2&user[password]=user2&user[company]=2`

We got internal Server Error, which might be because of invalid attribute.

We will try again with `company_id`. Our payload will be `user[username]=user2&user[password]=user2&user[company_id]=2`

Done!.
