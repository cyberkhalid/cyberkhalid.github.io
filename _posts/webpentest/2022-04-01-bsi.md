# Broken Authentication -> Unencrypted Communication

If application allows users to connect to it over unencrypted connections(http). An attacker suitably positioned to view a legitimate user's network traffic could record and monitor their interactions with the application and obtain any information the user supplies.

In this case,we will try to login as admin with this credential `admin:admin`, and then sniff the http traffics with wireshark.

# Mitigations

- Use transport-level encryption (SSL/TLS).
- Use Strict-Transport-Security
