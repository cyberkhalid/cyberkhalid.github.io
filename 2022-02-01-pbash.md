# .bashrc

If a user has bash as their login shell, the ".bashrc" file in their home directory is executed when an interactive session is launched

# Exploitation

We are going to leverage .bashrc file to achieve persistence. We will create a reverse shell payload and add it to `.bashrc` file so that to be executed automatically when user logs in.

Now , we will setup our reverse shell listener and wait for a root user to logs in.
